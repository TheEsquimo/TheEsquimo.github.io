            <strong>Gunstronaut</strong> is a classic shooter in 2.5D, but with a twist; you can <em>only shoot!</em> <br />
            Manipulate gravity to your advantage - by <em>shooting</em> your way forward.<br /><br />
            The game is developed as a father-son project, with Elvis Sahlén on programming duty - and Kurt Sahlén as art-director; doing the 3D-modelling and animations.<br /><br />
            Gunstronaut is simple to pick up, but hard to master. Using only the mouse to play, you left-click to shoot gravity influencing projectiles, right click to use your gun's
            secondary fire and left click to reload. The reload mechanic is a time-based event, with the chance of reloading faster. You want to time your reloads, or you'll find
            yourself falling with no way of steering yourself.

        <p>
        "When I came up with this idea of only moving through shooting your way forward, it was 3AM on new years eve. I was, before this idea popped into my head, very tired and heading off to bed.
        Suddenly - I got this burst of inspiration and hype and wanted to get to coding this thing <strong><em>right away</em></strong>. I was pretty drunk, to put it mildly, so the code
        wasn't the <em>best</em> perhaps, but I don't think I would have started this project as quickly and passionately as I did, had I been sober.
        Even the title came to me immediately, and I think this stupid state of mind may have helped in making such a light-hearted, fun, dumb little idea.
        So what I'm saying is, drinking is good for you - or something like that"<br /><br />
